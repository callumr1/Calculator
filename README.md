This is a simple calculator app that I made using HTML, Sass, and Javascript. The goal of this project was to create a minimalist style site in a dark mode theme, along with gaining more experience in enhancing a pages functionality with minimal javascript.

I had been using jQuery quite frequently when I decided to start this project, and instead decided to use plain vanilla javascript as I wanted to minimalise its impact on page load. I had also wanted to gain more experience with using Sass and Grunt to process the Sass styles into CSS.

I had been wanting to create another primarily dark themed site again as I personally prefer dark themes and wanted to explore design options in this space. this was a fun side-project that allowed me to further my design experience, while also building my experience with creating light weight, reponsive websites.

Possible improvment ideas:
 - [x] Add styling for mobile devices
 - [x] Improve accessibility
 - [x] Make the calculator screen more calculator-like
